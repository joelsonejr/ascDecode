# ascDecode
Simple app to decode strings. 
======================================

Here you check how it's looking so far: https://joelsonejr.github.io/ascDecode/ .

This app came as an aswer to a challenge a participated. The full picture:

There is a program that encodes strings. What it does is take a string, replace each character for it's equivalent in ASCII, turn it backwards, and return it. For example:

hello ---convert to asc -> 104101108108111 ---put it backwards--> 111801801101401

The chalenge was to write a function (I've used a set of them), to receive that encoded string and return it decoded. 

After finishing the challenge, I decided to improve the app a little bit more. Right now it's capable of encrypting and decrypting the string (there's still a lot of refactoring to be done). I've also added a very basic UI and UX, just to see things working. 
As soon as I'm done making the code look a litter better, I'll put some work in the UI and the UX.
