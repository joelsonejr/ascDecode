# ascDecode
Simple app to decode strings. 
======================================

Here you check how it's looking so far: https://joelsonejr.github.io/ascDecode/ .

This app came as an aswer to a challenge a participated. The full picture:

There is a program that encodes strings. What it does is take a string, replace each character for it's equivalent in ASCII, turn it backwards, and return it. For example:

hello ---convert to asc -> 104101108108111 ---put it backwards--> 111801801101401

The chalenge was to write a function (I've used a set of them), to receive that encoded string and return it decoded. 
My next steps will be to write the encode function. After that, build a front end for the whole thing.
